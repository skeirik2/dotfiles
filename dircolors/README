# DEBUGGING DIRCOLORS

Note dircolors files come in two flavors:
- a legacy ANSI variant
- a newer 256-color variant

The newer format is a superset of the prior format. The only difference is
that newer format supports more color code designations; i.e. there are
color code designators:

- foreground colors: 38;5;<0-255>
- background colors: 38;5;<0-255>

If you see such a color designator in a dircolors file, that means it should
only be used with terminals that properly support 256 colors.

NOTE: This is DIFFERENT from 24-bit color support (so-called "true color").
      Representing 256 colors only requires 8-bits; as of writing, many
      terminals still do not support 24-bit colors.

To check for 256 color support, search for a terminal color test script online
and run it. If you terminal does not support enough colors, that may be
the issue. If your terminal does support colors, it may be a conflict be
dircolors and other terminal colors. In that case, try disabling things.

To isolate the problem, you can disable:

1) Terminal externally configured colorschemes (e.g. iTerm, mintty, etc...)
2) Terminal internally configured colorschemes --- scripts using escape codes
   to change terminal colors
3) Terminal multiplexer programs, e.g. tmux, screen

After disabling something, you can try to load the colorscheme again and
see if you obtain the desired result.
