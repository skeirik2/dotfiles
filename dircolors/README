# DEBUGGING DIRCOLORS

Apparently, dircolors files come in two flavors:
- a legacy ANSI variant
- a newer 256-color variant

256 color variants are only supported by terminals that support 256 colors.
To check for 256 color support, search for a terminal color test script online
and run it. If you terminal does not support enough colors, that may be
the issue. If your terminal does support colors, it may be a conflict be
dircolors and other terminal colors. In that case, try disabling things.

To isolate the problem, you can disable:

1) Terminal externally configured colorschemes (e.g. iTerm, mintty, etc...)
2) Terminal internally configured colorschemes --- scripts using escape codes
   to change terminal colors
3) Terminal multiplexer programs, e.g. tmux, screen

After disabling something, you can try to load the colorscheme again and
see if you obtain the desired result.
